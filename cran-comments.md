  * New submission

    This is my first submission of this package.

  * Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
      Cramer (10:11)
      Kuiper (10:3)
      Mises (10:22)
      Wasserstein (11:16, 12:3)
      von (10:18)

    These are names of people.
    I cannot change how they are spelled.
    The names are closely related to package objectives,
    so removing them from the description would be detrimental.
