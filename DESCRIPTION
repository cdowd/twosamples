Author: Connor Dowd

Description: Fast randomization based two sample tests.
  Testing the hypothesis that two samples come from the same distribution 
  using randomization to create p-values. Included tests are: Kolmogorov-Smirnov,
  Kuiper, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling. There is also a very efficient new test
  based on the Wasserstein Distance as the default, 'two_sample', which builds on the 
  Wasserstein distance by using a weighting scheme like that of Anderson-Darling. See the 
  companion paper at <arXiv:2007.01360> or <https://codowd.com/public/DTS.pdf> for details of that test statistic, 
  and non-standard uses of the package (parallelising, weighted observations, etc). 
  We also include the permutation scheme to make test building simple for others.
