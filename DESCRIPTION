Title: Fast Permutation Based Two Sample Tests
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Connor Dowd
Maintainer: Connor Dowd <cdowd@chicagobooth.edu>
Description: Fast randomization based two sample tests.
  Testing the hypothesis that two samples come from the same distribution 
  using randomization to create p-values. Included tests are: Kolmogorov-Smirnov,
  Kuiper, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling. There is also a very efficient test
  based on the Wasserstein Distance. The default test 'two_sample' builds on the 
  Wasserstein distance by using a weighting scheme like that of Anderson-Darling.
  We also include the permutation scheme to make test building simple for others.
